|Idea| Does what?|
 |---|---|
 |[Dependencies](#dependencies)| What is relied upon for the LD to work?|
 |Beauty| What is intrinsically attractive about the outcome or process within the LD?|
 |Curiosity| What makes the LD outcome or process interesting?|
 |Importance| Why is the topic important?|
 |Essence| What is the essence of this chunk of learning?|
 |Utility| What can a student actually do (now, today) with the experience of this lesson?|
 |Thinking vices| What negative outcomes to avoid?|

- Dependent on?    Allows? Agree? Disagree? Irrelevant?



### Introduction, context, purpose
In my experience, motivating students is important. You need a range of 
motivations. Figuring out what is interesting, where a topic has beauty and how the 
process or topic fits in to study, life, career and academic rewards, seems to be
a good starting point for understanding or designing a lesson. 

All these questions can be applied optionally at progressively deep levels. One of 
questions, that relating to dependency, should always be thought through at depth and 
in multiple ways.

<p align="right"> <small>I make reference to outcomes, topic and process for a lesson here.<br>
By <strong>outcomes</strong> I mean what a student can <br>
demonstrate at the end of the lesson or sequence.<br>
By <strong>topic</strong> I mean the academic subject focus
for the lesson. <br>
By <strong>process</strong> I intend to convey the by-products, meta-cognitive<br>
and collaborative skills that are practiced and developed during the lesson.</small></p>

### Dependencies
#### Intra-lesson dependencies
Within a lesson, what depends upon what determines the order of components. It also shows 
what must be understood before next steps should occur. It forces the LD to explicitly consider 
what paths can be achieved through a lesson and what contingency for students who do not reach a
stage within the lesson for which later stages depend. At its simplest, the dependencies might 
be a linear sequence. Sometimes a many, perhaps parallel into one dependent component. Sometimes
a number of independent components - perhaps preparing for another lesson. 
#### Inter-lesson dependencies
You may create a lesson dependent on other prior lessons. The lesson you are designing may be 
depended upon by others. This should be very apparent and under control in a sequence of lessons. 
Perhaps not so apparent when relying upon skills and understanding which were developed as part of 
other lessons, possibly in different contexts, perhaps more than a few weeks ago.
#### Inter-subject and cultural capital dependencies
Relying on mathematics, English, science, design and technology, problem solving, collaborative working, listening,
speaking, politeness, life experience, STM, co-ordination skills? There may be benefits from
being more explicit about what your lessons need in place or will build for students in the
other subjects that they study.  The starting point and path for some students in the same class of students
will be different. It would be good to be explicit and document that in the LD.
