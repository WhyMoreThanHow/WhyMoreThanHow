### Introduction, context, purpose
In my experience, motivating students is important. You need a range of 
motivations. Figuring out what is interesting, where a topic has beauty and how the 
process or topic fits in to study, life, career and academic rewards, seems to be
a good starting point for understanding or designing a lesson. 

All these questions can be applied optionally at progressively deeper levels. One of the
questions, that relating to dependency, should always be thought through at depth and 
in multiple ways.

<p align="right"> <small>I make reference to outcomes, topic and process for a lesson here.<br>
By <strong>outcomes</strong> I mean what a student can <br>
demonstrate at the end of the lesson or sequence.<br>
By <strong>topic</strong> I mean the academic subject focus
for the lesson. <br>
By <strong>process</strong> I intend to convey the by-products, meta-cognitive<br>
and collaborative skills that are practiced and developed during the lesson.</small></p>

### Dependencies
#### Intra-lesson dependencies
Within a lesson, what depends upon what determines the order of its constituents. It also shows 
what must be understood before next steps should occur. It forces the LD to explicitly consider 
what paths can be achieved through a lesson and what contingency is needed for students who do 
not reach a level of understanding in a precursor 
stage within the lesson for which later stages depend. At its simplest, the dependencies might 
be in the form of a linear sequence. Sometimes parallel precursor components into one dependent one. Sometimes
a number of independent components - perhaps preparing for another lesson. 
#### Inter-lesson dependencies
You may create a lesson dependent on other prior lessons. The lesson you are designing may be 
depended upon by others. This should be very apparent and under control in a sequence of lessons. 
Perhaps not so apparent when relying upon skills and understanding which were developed as part of 
other lessons, possibly in different contexts, perhaps more than a few weeks ago.
#### Inter-subject and cultural capital dependencies
Relying on mathematics, English, science, design and technology, problem solving, collaborative working, listening,
speaking, politeness, life experience, Short-term memory capabilities, co-ordination skills? There may be benefits from
being more explicit about what your lessons need in place or will build for students in the
other subjects that they study.  The starting point and path for some students in the same class of students
will be different. It would be good to be explicit and document that in the LD. 

<p align="right" style="color:dodgerblue"> Does all this seem very obvious? I just haven't seen 
much of <br>
of  this in any of my training. Is it all obvious and therefore not documented? <br>
Or does such dependency documentation rapidly become unmanageable and <br>
arbitrarily bounded.I have certainly suffered  from schemes of work and <br>
lesson plans prepared by others which have assumed unrealistic knowledge <br>
and skills to be possessed by the students at the start of the sequence or lesson.<br> 
Similarly, sequences that assume progress that the most able students <br>
will make as a starting point for the next part of a sequence.<br>

###Beauty {#beauty}
[//]: #(This format does not work in PyCharm preview but works in Jekyll - plus this is a comment)

By beauty, I mean something that can be seen beyond mere utility or on a path to somewhere else,
that has an attractiveness. Visually attractive, neat idea, wow factor, memorable hook using a 
non-linguistic part of the brain - hard to describe with words; which may be a defining characteristic.
Answering 'What is beautiful about...(an aspect of the lesson or topic being taught)?' is
going to be a hard question to answer in many cases. It is still worth attempting to find
an answer on the motivational quest. It may also lead to a break from words, numbers and symbols, or
dull pictures of hardware. Not all beauty is visual, beautiful ideas may have to be expressed in words, 
I am looking for something that is a deeper, perhaps philosophical, more elegant idea which might not 
be apparent (or even normally considered by practitioners in topic area).  
<p align="right" style="color:dodgerblue">
As an example for KS3 students, binary numbers - something visual - perhaps something along the lines 
of denary number sequences as binary patterns to weave a two colour ribbon?

[//]: #( Graphic has designed pattern followed by descending numbers)<br>
As an example for KS5, non-visual idea based beauty, the more fundamental and real world analogy to
object oriented programming of classes of biological cells sending chemical messages to each other. 
(I find this beautiful because it takes the weirdness of OOP, and brings it into another domain
with all the evolutionarily evolved complexity and wonder of biological organisms - it isn't a 
perfect fit as an analogy, though.)

###Curiosity {curiosity}
