### *Questions summary link page*

<small>These are opinions expressed as statements for clarity. I am not burdened by being
an academic, nor falsely encouraged by any narrow practitioner research 'success' - 
so read critically, do your own research, find other sources and take what is useful.

#### Question categories being considered here: *(this in summary, details in posts?+ best bit in summary post - probably the key LD questions)
- root level, almost universally applicable questions (GQ)
- questions for lesson design (LD);
- questions for teachers to ask of students (TS);
- questions for everyone to ask of sources, commentators and subject matter 
  authorities (ES).    .

Further, there are levels of generality of applicability, level of granularity, and there are questions about questions or 
relationships between questions, perhaps they can be referred to as meta-questions (MQ).
