### Introduction, context, purpose
In my experience, motivating students is important. You need a range of 
motivations. Figuring out what is interesting, where a topic has beauty and how the 
process or topic fits in to study, life, career and academic rewards, seems to be
a good starting point for understanding or designing a lesson. 

All these questions can be applied optionally at progressively deeper levels. One of the
questions, that relating to dependency, should always be thought through at depth and 
in multiple ways.

I make reference to outcomes, topic and process for a lesson here.<br>
By <strong>outcomes</strong> I mean what a student can demonstrate at the end 
of the lesson or sequence.<br>
By <strong>topic</strong> I mean the academic subject focus for the lesson. <br>
By <strong>process</strong> I intend to convey the by-products, meta-cognitive 
and collaborative skills that are practiced and developed during the lesson.<br><br></p>

### Dependencies
#### Intra-lesson dependencies
Within a lesson, **what depends upon what** determines the order of its constituents. It also shows 
what must be understood before next steps should occur. It forces the LD to explicitly consider 
what paths can be achieved through a lesson and what contingency is needed for students who do 
not reach a level of understanding in a precursor 
stage within the lesson for which later stages depend. At its simplest, the dependencies might 
be in the form of a linear sequence. Sometimes parallel precursor components into one dependent one. Sometimes
a number of independent components - perhaps preparing for another lesson. 
#### Inter-lesson dependencies
You may create a lesson dependent on other prior lessons. The lesson you are designing may be 
depended upon by others. This should be very apparent and under control in a sequence of lessons. 
Perhaps not so apparent at the design stage, is the reliance upon skills and understanding
which were developed as part of other lessons, possibly in different contexts, perhaps 
more than a few weeks ago.
#### Inter-subject, learning skills and cultural capital dependencies
Relying on mathematics, English, science, design and technology, problem solving, collaborative working, listening,
speaking, politeness, life experience, short-term memory capabilities, co-ordination skills? There may be benefits from
being more explicit about what your lessons need to be in place or will build for students in the
other subjects that they study.  The starting point and path for some students in the same class of students
will be different. It would be good if this could be considered and explicitly documented in the LD
(and scheme of work and even the curriculum design).

Does all this seem very obvious? I just haven't seen much of 
this in any of my training. Is it all a professional 'given', obvious to an experienced educator
and therefore not documented? Or does such dependency documentation rapidly become unmanageable and 
arbitrarily bounded - and therefore foolish to attempt.<br><br>
I have certainly suffered  from schemes of work and 
lesson plans prepared by others which have assumed unrealistic knowledge 
and skills to be possessed by the students at the start of a sequence or lesson. 
Similarly, impossible schemes of work that assume lesson progress that the most able students 
will make as a starting point for the next part of a sequence, seem to be standard fare.

### Beauty 

[//]: # (Beauty is possibly going to be rejected by readers - perhaps needs some references to back it up)


By beauty, I mean something that can be seen beyond mere utility or on a path to somewhere else,
that has an attractiveness. Visually attractive, neat idea, wow factor, memorable hook using a 
non-linguistic part of the brain - hard to describe with words; which may be a defining characteristic.
Answering 'What is beautiful about...(an aspect of the lesson or topic being taught)?' is
going to be a hard question to answer in many cases. It is still worth attempting to find
an answer on the motivational quest. It may also lead to a break from words, numbers and symbols, or
dull pictures of hardware. Not all beauty is visual, beautiful ideas may have to be expressed in words. 
I am looking for something that is a deeper, perhaps philosophical, more elegant idea which might not 
be apparent (or even normally considered by practitioners in topic area).

As an example for KS3 students, binary numbers - something visual - perhaps something along the lines 
of denary number sequences as binary patterns to weave a two colour ribbon?</p>

<p align="left" style="color:green; font-family:verdana; font-size:85%;">
As an example for KS5, non-visual idea based beauty, the more fundamental and real world analogy to
object oriented programming of classes of biological cells sending chemical messages to each other. 
(I find this beautiful because it takes the weirdness of OOP, and brings it into another domain
with all the evolutionarily evolved complexity and wonder of biological organisms - it isn't a 
perfect fit as an analogy, though.)

<div id="essence"></div>

### Essence

As in *essential* part of the topic under study. The key defining characteristic of the studied area, 
which is particular and different compared to other topics. I think this is particularly important 
when an area of study is heavy in knowledge and specialist vocabulary rather than activity and higher
order thinking. The 'What is the essence of this topic?' question, is about sharing part of the under 
the surface iceberg of relevance, of why the topic is even included. It shares as an aspect of the 
expert perspective of a topic. (It might even be an attempt to convey the tacit knowledge of subject 
experts.)

---

<p align="left" style="color:green; font-family:verdana; font-size:85%;">
I sometimes think that this isn't even thought through by specification designers - or perhaps,
again I am not understanding that all experienced educators will see this as an obvious part of 
teaching and pop it in themselves. On the other hand I have seen GCSE resources (commercial and exam board)
that do not have any inking of this.<br>
An example looking at networked devices: the essence is independent black boxs, with different 
specialised functions, locations and creators being able to communicate with each other. Not all 
IBM, not all in the same building, not tightly interdependent. That's the essence of networks - 
not protocols, not the hardware, not the out of date topology types. <br>
I argue that without the essence as a backbone to everything else in the topic, 
you are just creating a list of facts to be known. (Which may 
be a subset of the facts and vocabulary that subject practitioners have. Of course, people who actually design and work
with networks may not even have considered this question about networks, but that does not mean that they
learned about their specialist area in the best way.) Having the knowledge today
that users in that subject area had a few years ago, probably isn't useful. It may be dull. It may be
off-putting to students. However, it does make a subject 'proper' because other academic subjects have 
lots of facts and it is easier to mark than a student's partially successful creative solution to 
a problem through programming.)<br>
Lastly here, the essence of a topic is more abstract and therefore relatable to other
fields or deeper questions - so perhaps some higher order thinking opportunities. A detailed realistic understaning
of network protocols, design constraints and metrics is never going to be 
amenable to higher order thinking without an unrealistic level of specialisation and
study time - it would have to be post-16 at least. However, the essence of networks can
be analysed, evaluated in different contexts and critically appraised. The essence can be looked at
as a solution to a more general problem in other domains. (See systems thinking.)
